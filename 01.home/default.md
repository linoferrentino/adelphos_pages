## Adelphos: a white paper

Adelphos (from the ancient Greek word for "brother") is a system that enables
users across regions or countries to exchange goods and services using a hybrid
of real currency (cash or deferred payments) and virtual credit. It builds on
natural human trust starting from small groups like families, scaling fractally
to larger structures like neighborhoods or communities. 

This creates a self-organizing network where trust grows organically but when
each user is able to control how much trust give to his direct connections.

The primary goal of adelphos is facilitate exchanges, but the ultimate goal is
to scale the trust to a partner or a son to a trust to a large group,
potentially thousands or millions without losing sight of the neighbour
next-door.

## A trust amplifier

Since ancient times humans have invented ways to amplify their powers;
fire, weapons, levers, machines, cars, planes, and now computers and
A.I.  are all tools to enhance various human capabilities, like the
ability to lift weights, to travel, to kill, to store and process
information.

But no significant steps have made to amplify theri capacity to love and to
care for other people in a objectively way. Religions, spiritual teaching have
done a great deal of work in educating people to care for people far from our
perceived reality.

Exiting the family borders trust drops drastically, like the bottom of an
ocean; sometimes in small groups trust survives, or, ironically, in "mafia"
style families united by crime.

In the 'civil' world little has been achieved; wars, oppressions and inequality
are still present; we do not fall into the trap of saying that "the past was
better", but certainly it was not "worse".

Sometimes we are still as we were in the tribes, closed and wary.

But how would it be if we created a system that helped humans to trust
each other? We should design a system that is able to mimic the way in
which humans care for each other.

This is the core of adelphos, We can define it a **trust amplifier**.

As a phone is able to carry our voice to the other part of the globe,
adelphos is able to uplevel our natural trust in the closest circle
(the family) to bigger and bigger groups.

This is done by the user themselves who organize themselves (hence the
word self-organizing) into bigger structures which are similar to the
ones at the lower levels (hence the word fractal).


<a id="similar-systems"></a>
## Similar systems

Based on my research two systems are similar to adelphos: the Credit
Commons and Ripple.

### Credit Commons

Credit commons (https://creditcommons.net/) is an evolution of
the LETS system which has been present since many years.

The LETS system enables a group of people to exchange goods and
services without using money.

The credit Commons expands this view using a tree of accounts
which grows fractally. The system is open source with a published
API and groups can potentially integrate larger groups using a
predefined rate of exchange between the credits.

### Ripple

Ripple is a form of monetary exchange between individuals where
users transform the real currency in a digital token which is
stored forever in an immutable blockchain and then it is
converted again in currency maybe in another part of the world,
without intermediates.

It issues also StableCoin, a virtual currency backed by
StableCoin.


## Adelphos: a closed ecosystem based on trust.

LETS is based on a total virtual currency while Ripple uses a
real currency, or, better, a virtual digital token which is
convertible in real money.

Adelphos wants to fill the niche between the two giving users the
possibility to choose the amount of trust to give into the system
which translates into the amount of credit.

Here we have the first axiom of adelphos: trust and credit are
linked (see [trust-in-adelphos](#trust-in-adelphos));

Another difference is that adelphos' first line of trust is
**not** the group, but the family, because this is where trust is
found. Like gold, trust is scarce and limited.

Another difference is that adelphos wants to be a closed
ecosystem; trust is so fragile that needs to be cultivated from
the bottom up.

If Alice sells a used phone and Bob wants to buy it, we need also
to build a trust to send this phone from Alice to Bob and to
exchange real money, this is used creating
[credit-lines](#credit-lines), adelphos creates also carrier
lines between groups that exploits the natural way in which
people move around, see [carrier-lines](#carrier-lines)

Adelphos can later also move people
[people-lines](#people-lines), or giving them shelter
[shelter-points](#shelter-points) or store goods waiting to be
collected [collect-points](#collect-points)

The difference with Ripple is that in adelphos the credit lines
are fractal and hybrid. They contain a part in cash and a part in
virtual credit and a part in real.

Of course we need trust to carry cash or items without relying on
external systems like banks and carriers, but this, in my
opinion, is the wall which has become an obstacle for systems
like LETS and Credit Commons to grow.

Adelphos will be successful if a child in Australia will be able
to send an action figure to a child in Italy without using an
external carrier like FedEx or similar, because the system will
exploit carrier lines of people who voluntary act as couriers of
goods in the system based on trust.


##  Economy and Trust Within Families
Families form the core of human trust and economy, regardless of culture. Key traits include:
- **Mutual trust**: Members rely on each other without constant tracking.
- **Shared responsibility**: Debts or obligations are collective.

Examples:
- Parents cover a child's mistakes (e.g., breaking a window).
- Spouses share financial liabilities, even with separate assets.

These principles underpin Adelphos' **Level Zero (L0) Trust**.

## Level Zero (L0): The Family Unit
In Adelphos, an L0 group isn't limited to biological families—it's any small unit acting as one economically.

Characteristics:
- **Shared ledger**: No individual accounts; all transactions are group-wide.
- **Full mutual responsibility**: Members are liable for all debts, including Redeemable Money (RM) and Unredeemable Money (UM).
- **External view**: The group appears as a single entity to outsiders.

Each group enters with a fixed equity (risk limit), capping total debt to prevent overextension.

## Level One (L1): The Cohort
L1 groups represent close friends or trusted allies—people you trust deeply but don't share daily finances with.

Key differences from L0:
- No shared living or joint accounts.
- Trust is limited: Informal for small exchanges, formal (e.g., IOUs) for larger ones.

Example:
> Alice and Lucy are close friends. They exchange small gifts without tracking debts. But if Lucy sells school books to Alice for $200, she expects cash or a formal IOU.

In Adelphos, L1 cohorts pool equities from L0 groups, exposing a portion (e.g., 50%) externally while maintaining internal trust.

##  Self-Organizing Nature of Adelphos
Adelphos grows fractally: Higher levels (e.g., L2 neighborhoods) mimic lower ones, with admins, pooled equities, and shared responsibilities. This allows organic expansion from families to communities, using routing like DNS for efficient credit paths (O(log n) complexity in balanced trees).

##  Not a Ponzi Scheme
Adelphos is the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. In Ponzi models, the top exploits the bottom without responsibility. Here, higher levels are liable for lower ones' debts, distributing risk upward and encouraging accountability.

##  Measuring Trust in Adelphos
Trust defies simple definition but, in Adelphos, it's the credit you're willing to extend—quantified by amount and time.

###  What Is Trust?
If Alice sells Bob a $300 phone and accepts a 30-day IOU, she's trusting him for $300 over that period. Longer delays may include interest (e.g., $310 after a year for 3%).

###  Trust as a Measurable Concept
Trust is the delayed payment you're willing to accept. Example:
> Selling a €4,000 car to a friend for €3,500 cash + €500 IOU yields a 12.5% trust ratio.

Adelphos records IOUs, making trust quantifiable and relational.

###  Philosophy of Trust
Adelphos shifts from scarcity-based money to credit-based exchange without fully replacing currencies. Users set personal trust thresholds to limit risk.

###  The Axiom of Adelphos
One unit of trust equals one unit of currency exchanged. We denote currency as τ (Tao).

###  The Human Unit
Currencies vary; the "human unit" (τ_HV) is the smallest meaningful amount (e.g., $1 in the US, 1,000 pre-Euro Lire in Italy).

###  The Trust-bel: Unit of Trust
Trust is measured in trust-bel (tb):
```
trust-bel = 10 * log10(τ / τ_HV)
```
Where τ is postponed currency, τ_HV is the human unit.

Example 1 (USA):
> Alice lends Bob $100 (τ_HV = $1).  
> tb = 10 * log10(100 / 1) = 20 tb.

Example 2 (pre-Euro Italy):
> Anna lends Bruno 1,000,000 Lire (τ_HV = 1,000 Lire).  
> tb = 10 * log10(1,000,000 / 1,000) = 30 tb.

The logarithmic scale reflects how trust grows non-linearly.

###  Trust in Practice
Trust-bel standardizes comparisons across currencies (e.g., using USD exchange rates for Yen). It's used for credit limits and routing.

##  Money in Adelphos
Money is either real (external cash) or deferred (internal credit).

Deferred types:
- **Redeemable Money (RM)**: IOU with a due date; may accrue interest.
- **Unredeemable Money (UM)**: Credit without a repayment date; lower trust typically.

###  Redeemable Money (RM)
Users set RM trust levels, limiting acceptance.

Example:
> Alice buys a $300 phone from Bob (20 tb trust).  
> RM_max = 10^(20 / 10) * $1 = $100.  
> She pays $200 cash + $100 RM IOU.

RM is spendable within limits.

Further Example:
> Bob uses $60 RM for Lucy's lessons (she accepts up to $100). He has $40 left.

Observations:
- Trust is relational (Lucy trusts the IOU issuer).
- Credit accumulates; exceeding limits requires cash.

###  Unredeemable Money (UM)
Similar to RM but indefinite. Users set separate (often lower) trust levels.

Key Differences:
- RM may include interest; UM does not.
- Users are fully liable for their own RM/UM, but only RM from invited friends.

## License

Of course a trust amplifier needs to be trusted: the trust begins from the
system. This is why I have decided to license it under the GPL license. In this
way the system will remain free and each modification on it must have the same
freedom as the initial one.
