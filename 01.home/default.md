## What is ἀδελφός?

Adelphos is at its core a system to create a decentralized web of trust with a user defined metric. This web of trust is then used to let people exchange good and services without using money or using it in part.

## Is it another cryptocurrency?
No, users buy and sell in adelphos using their normal currency, Euros or Dollars.

## Is it a time bank or a complementary currency like the LETS system?
No, in the LETS system the payments are always virtual. Alice gives to Bob 10 credits which do not have any correspondence to real money, instead in adelphos the payment is done with real money but some (or all) of the payment is not done in reality. It remains as an open credit.

Users accept to delay some payment because they have built a trust between them and the system limits automatically the amount of credit which a user does hold.
## Is it a Ponzi scheme?
Absolutely not. There is not any benefit to "arrive first" at the top of the pyramid. Users are encouraged to exchange in this system, but they do not give money to the first comers. There is actually a benefit in using the system, but it is relative to our willingness to trust others.
## Is it a virtual bank?
More or less, yes. But in the system the credit is dispersed along trust-ways, it is not centralized like in a bank.
