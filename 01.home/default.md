# 🌐 What Is ἀδελφός?

**ἀδελφός** is a decentralized system for building a web of trust, using a custom metric based on a logarithmic scale — similar to how sound intensity is measured in decibels.

This web of trust allows people to exchange goods and services:
- Without using money
- Or using money only partially

Instead of relying on external banks, **ἀδελφός uses human trust** as the basis for credit and exchange.  
This isn’t a radical idea — it already exists within families.  
ἀδελφός simply extends that familial trust outward into society.

## 🏡 Economy and Trust Within Families

Let’s begin by understanding how trust and economy function in a family.

Despite cultural differences, most families share two universal traits:
- **Mutual trust**
- **Shared responsibility**

Examples:
- Families divide chores and maintain shared spaces.
- Parents give children pocket money.
- Spouses often share a joint account for bills and expenses.

If a child breaks a window, the parents pay.  
If a spouse takes on debt, the other may be liable — even with separate assets.

### 🧠 Key Principles

1. **Members are responsible for each other’s debts.**  
2. **The family acts as a single economic unit.**

This is the foundation of **Level Zero (L0) Trust** in ἀδελφός.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Level Zero (L0): The Family Unit

In ἀδελφός, a Level Zero group is not necessarily a biological family, but it behaves like one.

### Characteristics:
- A shared ledger for all members (no individual accounts)
- Full mutual responsibility for all debts (RM and UM)
- The external world sees the group as a **single entity**

Each member is liable for all money issued by the group — whether **redeemable (RM)** or **unredeemable (UM)**.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Level One (L1): Close Friends

Level One represents our **closest friends** — those we trust deeply but don’t share daily life with.

### Key Differences from L0:
- No shared living space or joint account
- Trust exists, but is **limited to certain transactions**

#### 🧾 Example

> Alice and Lucy are teenage friends.  
> They buy each other small gifts — earrings, bracelets — without tracking who owes what.  
> But when Lucy wants to sell her school books to Alice for $200, she expects real money or a formal promise (RM).

### Characteristics of L1:
- Not part of the same family (L0)
- Willing to accept RM or UM for **larger expenses**
- For small exchanges, trust is informal and untracked

## 🧬 Self-Organizing Nature of ἀδελφός

A Level One group forms automatically when a user invites a friend **outside their family**.

Two scenarios:
1. The user has already invited others
2. This is their first invitation

In both cases, the inviter **endorses** the invitee and becomes **liable for their RM debts**.

#### 🧾 Example

> Alice creates an L0 group (her family).  
> She invites Lucy and Barbara, forming an L1 group called “The Queens.”  
> Lucy and Barbara don’t know each other.  
> Barbara wouldn’t normally accept RM from Lucy — but since Alice endorsed Lucy, Barbara can trust that Alice will cover any default.

### 🔄 Trust Chain

Every L1 member has at least one **endorser** who is liable for their debts.  
This chain continues up to the **founder**, who is ultimately responsible.

## 🚫 Not a Ponzi Scheme

Unlike a Ponzi scheme — where the base supports the top — ἀδελφός works in reverse:

- The **top is liable for the bottom**
- Growth is **naturally limited** by available trust
- When a group becomes too large, it **splits like a cell**

This is the beginning of ἀδελφός’s **self-organizing architecture**, which will be explored further.
