# 👤 User in ἀδελφός, basic concepts

A user in **ἀδελφός** is not like a typical user in a social media platform or
commercial service. By registering, you implicitly **trust the system and its
philosophy**, and you accept **responsibility for the people you may later
invite**.

---

## 🔐 Trust Begins with the System

This isn’t unusual — it mirrors real life.

- When you open a bank account, you trust the bank to safeguard your money.
- When you dine at a restaurant, you trust the chef to prepare a safe meal.
- Even being born in a country implies trust: in its laws, institutions, and future.

In **ἀδελφός**, this foundational trust is formalized at registration.

## 💱 Step One: Choosing Your Currency

During registration, you select your **real-world currency**.  
While ἀδελφός uses real money, some of it is exchanged directly, and some is held as **cheques (IOUs)** between trusted users.

> **Note:**  
> ἀδελφός will never ask you for money.  
> Use of the system is and will remain **completely free** — both in cost and in principle.

---

## 📊 Defining Your Trust Levels

You’ll define two trust thresholds:
- **RM (Redeemable Money)** — credit with a due date
- **UM (Unredeemable Money)** — credit without a due date

### 🔑 Key Principle

> You control how much personal money you allow into the system.  
> But you are also responsible for converting it back to real money if you choose to leave.

---

### 🧾 Example: Bob Registers

Bob sets:
- **RM trust**: 20tb → `10^(20/10) × $1 = $100`
- **UM trust**: 10tb → `10^(10/10) × $1 = $10`

This means:
- Bob can **receive up to $100 in RM** and **$10 in UM**
- These limits also define how much **credit he can extend to others**

---

### 🛍️ Bob Buys a Phone from Alice

Alice has:
- RM trust: 30tb → `$1000`
- UM trust: 20tb → `$100`

The phone costs **$300**.  
Even though Alice is willing to accept all $300 in RM, Bob’s RM limit is only $100.

So Bob pays:
- `$100 in RM`
- `$10 in UM`
- `$190 in real money (cash)`

> **Reciprocity Principle**  
> If a user sets low trust, others will offer them limited trust in return.

## 🚪 Two Ways to Enter ἀδελφός

1. **Register independently**  
   - You build your trust network from scratch  
   - You are responsible for those you invite

2. **Join via invitation**  
   - You are not responsible for users who joined before you  
   - You are responsible for those you invite

> Your responsibility is always capped by the trust level you chose at registration.  
> Invited users may choose high trust, but their effective trust is limited by their inviter’s endorsement.

---

### 🧾 Example: Bob Invites Alice

Bob registers with:
- RM trust: 25tb → `$316`
- UM trust: 15tb → `$31.6`

If Alice issues a **$100 RM cheque**, Bob’s remaining liability is:
- `$316 - $100 = $216`

> This reflects how **endorsement creates responsibility**.  
> If Alice defaults, Bob is liable — up to his declared trust capacity.
