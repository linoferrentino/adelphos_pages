## First step

A user in ἀδελφός is not like a _normal_ user in a social media site
or a commercial organization. 

You do not register in adelphos as a single, but as a group of at
least two people.

If you want to build a trust network... you have to start with someone
who you trust!


In this first step you will choose the currency which is used by you
and your _initial_ friend or family member.

* In this initial version of adelphos each user and their family
  (level zero) can use only one currency.

* A user can have friends with different currencies but they must not
  be their first.

* Level zero and One groups share the same currency: friendships of
  different currencies will be built from level two and above.


Adelphos uses _real_ money but some of this money is exchanged and
some is kept in the system in the form of cheques between users who
trust each other.

**At no time the system will ask you for money! Use of adelphos is and
will be totally free! (free as in free beer and free speech)**

The cheques which we are talking about is money which you will be
credited or debited because of real transactions in the real world,
not because you are using this system!
