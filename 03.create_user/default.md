## Trust begins from the bottom.

A user in adelphos is not isolated from the start. You do not
enter in adelphos as a 'normal' user in a social network and then
add friends later.

In adelphos you register as a user part of your _innermost_ trust
group, the people you trust completely, your **family**, which in
adelphos is called also the __level zero__.

You can also enter in adelphos if you have received an invite: in
this case you need to trust the person who has invited you, but
here we concentrate on the building phase.


## Why this?

The reason is that adelphos is a system based on trust. Trust is
a scarce resource, and we find it usually in the bottom, in a
family, where it is abundant (it should be!), to bring it
upwards.

So registering in adelphos forces you to think about your
__family__.

Which is it? For many family is biological: parents and children.
For others it can be a group of people who are not linked by
blood but by common interests and values.

To help understand which is your family let's talk about money.

> __In adelphos the family is the group of people who you trust at
> the point to risk your REAL money with them__

Not virtual credit or cryptocurrencies, real money: dollars,
euros, whatever is your local real currency.

Let's dive into it better, because this is the core of adelphos.

Adelphos needs a way to force users to build a stable trust
network and it builds it from the bottom, the foundations.

You might have a loving friend, but you might not trust him to
the point of giving him your PIN of your credit card.

But maybe with your spouse you have a joined bank account.

This is the difference: there are people whom you share debits
and credits with.

This is not without limits, however. For example you might have
children who you trust but with a somewhat restricted access to
the family's wealth.

For example you might not want to give your PIN to your teenager
son who will deplete your bank account buying the latest graphics
card or the most expensive pair of shoes.

    __Trust to a person has a credit limit, and this limit is the measure of trust.__

This is the foundation of adelphos.


## What if I do not have a family (or I do not want disclose mine?)

Even if it is discouraged this it's not a problem, you can enter
adelphos with a family of one: you.

However this is a degenerate case and you are still asked to name
your family because you can later change your view and, in any
case, for adelphos you are simply a family of one.

If you want, then, register into adelphos even if alone, but in
your mind take into consideration that you are telling adelphos
that you trust nobody except yourself.

## What if I do not trust the system and I want only to try?

That's a fair question. Remember that adelphos will __NEVER__ ask
you for money (but if you want to donate to the author I will be
grateful!, see the About page).

The answer is that you can limit the trust which you give to the
system in the next page.

Trust is credit and credit is trust: you can say that you trust
adelphos only for 20 Euro (for example).

20 Euro, or better, 13 τbel (see the trust chapter in the white
paper), will be the maximum amount of money that you can lose by
joining the system.

A logarithmic scale cannot give zero, so we cannot model a zero
trust, but you could in theory enter adelphos with a trust of
only -30 τbel, which is equivalent to 0.001 Euro.

Of course this will render adelphos useless, because you do not
trust anybody and nobody will trust you.

This is why it is important to start with a family, because
you are forced to think about your initial trust net and how much
trust you are willing to give.





In this page you will decide your user name and the name of your _family_.

In adelphos for _family_ we intend the (somewhat restricted) group of
people whom you personally trust to the point that their debts are
your debts and their credits are your credits.

If you want to make a comparison in civil code the _family_ in
adelphos is like a people's company, in which all the people in the
company share the fortunes and misfortunes of the company without
limits.

## Limits in Adelphos

But in adelphos there are limits and these are the limits based by the
level of trust between the members, that is you **never** will have to
pay more than you set here as a limit of the trust in the system and
in your family members.

On top of that you can set limits for adult members and limits for
minors.

## What you are asked here.

For now you are asked to give a name to you and your family. It does
not matter if for now you don't want to add other family members, you
will have a family of one, and that's OK.

In any case you will have to choose a name, and your complete name in
adelphos will be

_name_._family_@...


Where ... will be the other groups in which you will enter (more on
that later).

For now you can think about the family as the _level zero_, the ground
of trust which you will use later to build.

It is natural to think as _family_ your surname, but this is not
necessary. A name of "basketball_team" is good enough, if you think
that the basketball_team is your family.

You can only be in ONE family, however, all the other friends will be
in other levels.
