## You must trust the system, too.

This isn't unusual.

- When you open a bank account, you trust the bank to safeguard your money.
- When you dine at a restaurant, you trust the chef to prepare a safe meal.
- Even being born in a country implies trust: in its laws, institutions, and future.

In **adelphos**, this foundational trust is formalized at registration.

# If adelphos is free, why do I have to choose a currency?

The system is free, but you enter into the system to exchange
goods and service using a combination of three kinds of money:

- Cash ( τ₀ )
- Deferred money ( τ<sub>n</sub>)
- Unredeemable Credit ( τ<sub>∞</sub>)

The first two types of money have a direct link to a normal
currency, so you must choose one.

Remember that you are building your first level of trust, and
this is built by using your acquired skill in evaluating value
with your every-day currency.

**adelphos** uses this skill in giving value to things in
monetary terms to measure the trust that you have towards others.

The trust is measured in τbel, which, even if is a number, it is
related to the amount of credit that you wish to risk.
