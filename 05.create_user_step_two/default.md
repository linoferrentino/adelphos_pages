# Step two, your name and your family's name.


In this page you will decide your user name and the name of your _family_.

In ἀδελφός for _family_ we intend the (somewhat restricted) group of
people whom you personally trust to the point that their debts are
your debts and their credits are your credits.

If you want to make a comparison in civil code the _family_ in
adelphos is like a people's company, in which all the people in the
company share the fortunes and misfortunes of the company without
limits.

## Limits in Adelphos

But in adelphos there are limits and these are the limits based by the
level of trust between the members, that is you **never** will have to
pay more than you set here as a limit of the trust in the system and
in your family members.

On top of that you can set limits for adult members and limits for
minors.

To get more details in trust in adelphos see [trust in adelphos](../trust)

## What you are asked here.

For now you are asked to give a name to you and your family. It does
not matter if for now you don't want to add other family members, you
will have a family of one, and that's OK.

In any case you will have to choose a name, and your complete name in
adelphos will be

_name_._family_@...


Where ... will be the other groups in which you will enter (more on
that later).

For now you can think about the family as the _level zero_, the ground
of trust which you will use later to build.

It is natural to think as _family_ your surname, but this is not
necessary. A name of "basketball_team" is good enough, if you think
that the basketball_team is your family.

You can only be in ONE family, however, all the other friends will be
in other levels.
