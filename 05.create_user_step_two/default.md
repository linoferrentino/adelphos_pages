# If ἀδελφός is free, why do I have to choose a currency?

While ἀδελφός uses real money, some of it is exchanged directly, and some is
held as **cheques (IOUs)** between trusted users.

> **Note:**  
> ἀδελφός will **NEVER** ask you for money.  
> Use of the system is and will remain **completely free** — both in cost and in principle.

A user in **ἀδελφός** is not like a typical user in a social media platform or
commercial service. By registering, you implicitly **trust the system and its
philosophy**, and you accept **responsibility for the people you may later
invite**.

# Trust begins with the system

This isn’t unusual.

- When you open a bank account, you trust the bank to safeguard your money.
- When you dine at a restaurant, you trust the chef to prepare a safe meal.
- Even being born in a country implies trust: in its laws, institutions, and future.

In **ἀδελφός**, this foundational trust is formalized at registration.

**ἀδελφός** uses your natural skill in giving value to things in monetary terms
to measure the trust that you have towards others.

The trust is measured in t-bel, which, even if is a number, it is related to the
amount of credit that you wish to risk.
