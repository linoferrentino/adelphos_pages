# 🤝 Trust in ἀδελφός

Trust, like love, escapes a formal definition. However, in **ἀδελφός**, trust is measured as the amount of money we are willing to postpone for a person or group.

## 💡 What Is Trust?

If Alice sells a used phone to Bob for $300 and Bob promises to pay in a month, Alice is trusting Bob for **$300 over 30 days**.

Thus, trust is a **function of two variables**:
- **Quantity** (amount of money)
- **Time** (duration of delay)

In real life, longer delays often require **interest** to compensate for risk. For example:

> Bob promises Alice that if she waits one year, he will pay her $310 — a 3% interest.

## 📐 Trust as a Measurable Concept

In ἀδελφός, trust is defined as the **amount of delayed money** we are willing to sacrifice in the present.

When I receive a payment from someone, I give **trust** to them, and that trust is proportional to the **credit** I extend.

### 🧾 Example

> Suppose we sell a used car to our wife’s best friend, Lucy.  
> The market price is €4,000. Lucy has only €3,500.  
> We accept €3,500 in cash and €500 as an IOU.  
> The trust ratio is:  
> `500 / 4000 = 12.5%`

This 12.5% represents the **trust** we place in Lucy. The system records this IOU, and the trust becomes quantifiable.

## 🧭 Philosophy of Trust in ἀδελφός

Trust is the **amount of credit** I’m willing to accept from another party. ἀδελφός does not aim to replace national currencies entirely — it encourages a gradual shift from **scarcity-based money** to **credit-based exchange**.

Each participant defines their own **trust threshold** when joining the system, limiting their exposure and risk.

## 📊 The Axiom of ἀδελφός

We use a **logarithmic scale** to model trust, because doubling the amount of credit doesn’t necessarily double the trust.

### 🔺 Axiom:
> _One unit of trust equals one unit of currency exchanged._

To represent currency generically, we use the Greek letter **Tao (τ)**.

## 🧮 The Human Unit

Currencies vary widely in value. The **human unit** is the smallest amount of money that can buy something meaningful in a given country.

Examples:
- In pre-Euro Italy, 1 Lira was meaningless — but **1,000 Lire** could buy a coffee.
- In hyperinflated economies, the human unit might be **1 million** of the local currency.
- In the US, **$1** is a usable human unit.

We use the human unit to compute **trust as a dimensionless value**.

## 📏 The Trust-bel: Unit of Trust

Trust is measured using the **trust-bel (tb)**, defined as:

    trust-bel = 10 * log10(τ / τ_HV)



Where:
- `τ` = amount of postponed currency
- `τ_HV` = human value of currency

---

### 🧮 Example 1: USA

Alice lends Bob **$100**.  
Human value in the US = **$1**


trust-bel = 10 * log10(100 / 1) = 10 * 2 = 20 tb


---

### 🧮 Example 2: Italy (pre-Euro)

Anna lends Bruno **1,000,000 Lire**.  
Human value = **1,000 Lire**

trust-bel = 10 * log10(1,000,000 / 1,000) = 10 * 3 = 30 tb


Even though the amount increased fivefold (from $100 to €500), the trust-bel only increased by 10 units — reflecting the logarithmic nature of trust.

---

## 🧠 Trust in Practice

In ἀδελφός, trust-bel will be used throughout the system. The **human value** is approximated using the average exchange rate between the local currency and the dollar.

Examples:
- For Yen, we use **100 Yen** as the human unit, since $1 ≈ ¥100.
