# Trust and responsibility

In ἀδελφός we have seen that a user is responsible for the people he invites into
the system.

This responsibility is rewarded by an interest in RM (reedemable money), otherwise
there would not be an incentive to create a group.

However it is also important to differentiate this from a Ponzi scheme where the
top does not bear any responsibility and simply gains from the bottom.

In adelphos the concept is clear:

    each one can take responsibility for his actions but this responsibility is rewarded
    with an interest in the transaction.

This is also different from a cryptocurrency like bitcoin. In Bitcoin, for
example, the "miners" are rewarded with bitcoins because they find the solution
to the hash problem (a mathematically difficult problem) and they finalize the
transaction in a block cryptographically chained to the previous one.

In adelphos there are no miners, the endorsers gain a reward simply because
they are risking with their money the insolvence of the users in their group.

The reward is what they gain for their risk.

The UM, however, does not get an interest because it is not easily converted in real money.


## How the group splits

Suppose that Alice creates a group in dollar currency with initial trust of 30tb in Reedemable money
and 10tb in unreedemable money.
This means that she is willing to cover the debts of the users of the group up until
1,000$, because 30tb are 1,000$ in real money, and the debts of her family up to 1010$, because
10tb are 10$ and remember that in a family we are responsible for all money, either reedemable or not.

Of course she will invite in her family members she can trust fully and in her group people
who she can trust at least as friends, because if they do a debt and go away, she has to pay for them
up to 1,000$.

Suppose that she invites in her family her husband and a teenage son, and as a group of people five collegues
from work.

The collegues will then invite other three friends and we have a group of

    3 (family of Alice) + 5 (friends) + 3 x 5 (friends of friens) = 23 people.
