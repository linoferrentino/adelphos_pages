# Levels in adelphos

In adelphos users belong to groups and these groups belong in outer groups in a
hiearchy.

This hierarchy is used to issue credits and debits at various levels and to compute
the optimal route of a cheque when a user wants to pay another user in the system.

This hierarchy is also used to divide responsibility between users who do not
know themselves and to maintain strong the trust in the lowest level, the level
zero of the family.

Let's remember that in adelphos the level of trust given to a certain person equals
to the level of risk that I am willing to take by giving trust to him.


## Level zero, the family, maximum trust and maximum risk.

The level zero in adelphos is the riskiest and it is called the "family"

All the people belonging to a certain family are liable for all the debts of
the members in the family, in total. There is not a separate ledger, all
the people in the family share the same ledger, debts and credits.

In the family all the people trust and warrants each other to a certain
level which is defined when the family is estabilished.


## Level one, the cohort

The next level in adelphos is the cohort.

In the cohort the families have different ledgers but they know and trust
each other but with different levels.

A family can be richer or poorer, or simply can have a different propension
to spending and risk.

But the enforcement that all the families know each other is still present.

All groups in adelphos are densely connected, that is, if a group is composed
of five entities, each entity knows the four others.

## level two and above.

From level two to above the groups have not a certain name, but we might call
them with larger and larger groups, like neighborough, city, state, continent.

## the Hiearchy

You can see that even if all levels are interconnected at the same level, this
does not hold to lower levels.

That is, if city A and city B are interconnected in the same region R1 and city C and
city D are interconnected in region R2, this means that A and B can trade
with C and D only by uplevelling their credits to the level of regions.

## The upleveling of credit.

In adelphos the cheques circulate in a certain level as liquid money but they
need to be up-leveled to go up and down in the hierarchy.

## Example.

Alice in city A wants to pay Bob in city B.

Alice will emit a cheque, but then it is upleveled to the level of the city,
So it is the entire city A to be in debt.

## sum of warrants.

The rule is simple. Each entity must not be in debt more than the sum of his
warrants.

For example if a city has a warrant of 10,000$ it cannot be more in debt than
10,000$.
