## Login help

Here you can enter in adelphos.

Remember that adelphos is **not** like any other system: you enter in adelphos
as a user inside a __family__.

So your login in adelphos will always be something like

    user_name.family 

Where **family** is your level zero group.

If this does not see familiar, please go to the [trust](/trust) page for an explanation.
    
You can register a new family in the register page or you can be invited in
adelphos by someone else that has created a family for you.
